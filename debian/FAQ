1)  How can I detect if the kernel support systrace

While booting the systrace support write a message to dmesg

$ grep ^systrace /var/log/dmesg
systrace: systrace initialized


2)  I have no /dev/systrace device

You can create the device with the following command. Note: if you're
using devfs then it should be created automaticly

# mknod -m600 /dev/systrace c 10 226

For proper permissions see next section.


3)  Only root can use systrace. What's wrong?

The systrace command needs read and write access to the systrace
device (/dev/systrace or /dev/misc/systrace).

You should create a special systrace group, add the users to this group
and change the permissions of the device for this group.

# addgroup --system systrace
# adduser test systrace
# chown root.systrace /dev/systrace
# chmod 0660 /dev/systrace

If you are using devfs please see next question.


4)  After rebooting the devfsd reset the permissions

The devfs daemon doesn't know anything about the permissions, so it will
set the default after rebooting/initializing.

You can insert the following line to your /etc/devfsd/devfsd.conf

$ grep systrace /etc/devfs/devfsd.conf 
REGISTER        ^misc/systrace$         PERMISSIONS     root.systrace   0660
